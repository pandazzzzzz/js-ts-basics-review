# Tasks: JavaScript Concepts Coverage Review

## Phase 1: Coverage Analysis

- [x] 1. Build Concept Catalog from Reference Sources
  - [x] 1.1 Extract concepts from MDN JavaScript documentation
  - [x] 1.2 Extract concepts from JavaScript.info curriculum
  - [x] 1.3 Extract concepts from ECMAScript specification
  - [x] 1.4 Extract concepts from roadmap.sh JavaScript path
  - [x] 1.5 Consolidate concepts appearing in 2+ sources
  - [x] 1.6 Categorize concepts (basics/data-structures/core-concepts/asynchronous)
  - [x] 1.7 Assign importance levels (critical/high/medium/low)
  - [x] 1.8 Document concept catalog in structured format

- [ ] 2. Analyze Existing Demo Files
  - [x] 2.1 Review demo/basics/01-variables.js
  - [x] 2.2 Review demo/basics/02-operators.js
  - [x] 2.3 Review demo/basics/03-control-flow.js
  - [x] 2.4 Review demo/basics/04-strings.js
  - [x] 2.5 Review demo/data-structures/05-arrays.js
  - [x] 2.6 Review demo/data-structures/06-functions.js
  - [x] 2.7 Review demo/data-structures/07-objects.js
  - [x] 2.8 Review demo/core-concepts/08-scope-closures.js
  - [x] 2.9 Review demo/core-concepts/09-error-handling.js
  - [x] 2.10 Review demo/core-concepts/10-prototypes-inheritance.js
  - [x] 2.11 Review demo/core-concepts/11-modern-features.js
  - [x] 2.12 Review demo/asynchronous/12-event-loop-callbacks.js
  - [x] 2.13 Review demo/asynchronous/13-promises.js
  - [x] 2.14 Review demo/asynchronous/14-async-await.js
  - [x] 2.15 Review demo/asynchronous/15-modules.js
  - [x] 2.16 Build coverage map of concepts per file

## Phase 2: Gap Analysis and Prioritization

- [x] 3. Generate Gap Report
  - [x] 3.1 Compare concept catalog against coverage map
  - [x] 3.2 Identify missing concepts (zero coverage)
  - [x] 3.3 Identify insufficient concepts (low depth coverage)
  - [x] 3.4 Group missing concepts by category
  - [x] 3.5 Calculate coverage statistics
  - [x] 3.6 Document gap report in markdown format

- [x] 4. Prioritize Missing Concepts
  - [x] 4.1 Rank missing concepts by importance level
  - [x] 4.2 Determine suggested file locations
  - [x] 4.3 Identify concepts for new files vs additions to existing files
  - [x] 4.4 Create prioritized list of concepts to implement
  - [x] 4.5 Review priorities with user for feedback

## Phase 3: Skeleton Generation

- [x] 5. Generate File Skeletons for High-Priority Concepts
  - [x] 5.1 Create skeleton for first high-priority concept
  - [x] 5.2 Create skeleton for second high-priority concept
  - [x] 5.3 Create skeleton for third high-priority concept
  - [x] 5.4 Create skeleton for fourth high-priority concept
  - [x] 5.5 Create skeleton for fifth high-priority concept

- [x] 6. Validate Skeleton Quality
  - [x] 6.1 Verify file naming follows NN-topic-name.js pattern
  - [x] 6.2 Verify all required sections are present
  - [x] 6.3 Verify comment style matches project conventions
  - [x] 6.4 Verify ES version annotations are included
  - [x] 6.5 Verify TODO markers are placed appropriately
  - [x] 6.6 Verify TypeScript comparison section is included
  - [x] 6.7 Compare skeletons with existing demo files for consistency

## Phase 4: Documentation and Review

- [x] 7. Document Findings
  - [x] 7.1 Create comprehensive gap report document
  - [x] 7.2 Document coverage statistics
  - [x] 7.3 List all missing concepts with metadata
  - [x] 7.4 List all insufficient concepts with recommendations
  - [x] 7.5 Provide actionable next steps

- [x] 8. User Review and Iteration
  - [x] 8.1 Present gap report to user
  - [x] 8.2 Present generated skeletons to user
  - [x] 8.3 Gather user feedback on priorities
  - [x] 8.4 Refine skeletons based on feedback
  - [x] 8.5 Finalize implementation plan
